# Description

This work explores, if a CNN trained on the mnist dataset can be used to examine the quality of a diffusion model, that has been trained on the mnist model as well. This diffusion model is only trained on mnist data that has the label "2", so that the propability given by the CNN can be directly used for drawing a conclusion.
